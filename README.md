# camat
Cardiac Mapping analysis tool \n
A GUI based program to rapidly analyze optical mapping data (Calcium and Voltage)
Written by Rafael Jaimes III, PhD
The goal of camat is to automate optical mapping analysis as much as possible. A secondary goal is to support
as many filetypes and datatypes as possible. Currently, work has been done to support Zeiss, Nikon, Andor, and plain
txt files for both calcium and voltage maps. See the homepage http://www.cardiacmap.com for more information, or
